The Hochenberger study (2019)

Sniffin Sticks


Three pens presented, pick one

beta = 3.5
gamma (guessing) (1/3)
lambda (lapse rate) = 0.01 

PSI = l*g+(1-l)*(1-(1-g)*exp(-10^b*(x+T)))

granularity of concentration grid is set to 0.01.
Prior estimate had standard deviation of 20 and mena of seven (pen 7)

Target threshold at 80% correct

There are 16 possible concentrations.
The chosen triplet is the closest concentration.

20 trials
Final estimate of the threshold is the mean of the posterior probability density function.


16 is the smallest concentration  
1 is the largest concentration
